## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

It was an exciting and really simple project. The HTML markup was really simple. Most of the challenges i faced came from the styling while using CSS. Alot of padding was needed to make it look similar to the design. I also had to tweak the borders abit to give them the round edge look. I used mainly flexbox for most of the display properties so that it could the minimum height.

```css
body{
    min-height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
}

.card{
    padding: 18px;
    border-radius: 18px;
}
```

### Continued development

Looking towards the future i would really like to continue my development by gaining more knowlegde on CSS concepts like flexbox and grid and the different instances they can be used to give my projects   structures more stability. Queries are also a point of interest.
